## Component Libraries Showcased

### What components are we using?

For this project, we will use the following components (or their equivalents) for each library:

- Alert
- Drawer
- Dialog
- Card
- Breadcrumbs
- Stepper
- Various inputs
  We will build this with a stepper through three parts:
- Inputs

- Dialogs, alerts, and navigation
